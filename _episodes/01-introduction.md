## Introductions

> Introductions set the stage for learning.
>
> --- Tracy Teal, Former Executive Director, The Carpentries
{: .testimonial}

Hello everyone, and welcome to the **FAIR for leaders** workshop.
We are very pleased to have you with us.

> ## Today's Trainers
>
> To begin the class, each Trainer should give a brief introduction of themselves.

### Online workshop specifics

> ## Our learning tools
>
> Before we begin let's explain how to use the tools:
> * Raising hands
> * Yes/No sticker
> * Chatroom for links not for jokes
> * Breakout rooms, leaving and rejoining
> * using pad, answering questions in pad
> * where to find things
> If needed, check the pre workshop setup, ask to report problems
> and help at a break or after the session.
>
{: .discussion}

Now we would like to get to learn something about you.

> ## Who are you and what are your expectations from the workshop
>
> Please, Introduce yourselves telling each other why you have joined this course.
> Then, try to find one professional/academic thing that your group has in common. 
> For example:
> - we all had our latest grant proposals accepted by MRC
> - we are all desperately searching for an experienced lab technician

> ## You and data sharing
>
> Thinking of how you and your group make data or code available to others and how your group uses others’ data, write “+1” next to any statements that match your own experience:
> 
> - We do not really share data, we only publish the results as part of a publication:
> - We have made our data available only as Supporting Information for a paper:
> - We have made our data available as both Supporting Information and as a dataset in a repository:
> - We have made our data/code available without having it published in a paper:
> - We share the code in GitHub or another code repository:
> - We make the code available on demand:
> - We have used a dataset from a public repository:

## Better research by better sharing

For many of us, data management or output sharing in general
are considered a burden rather than a useful activity. Part of the problem
is our bad timing and lack of planning.

We will demonstrate to you:
- why you should know about Open Sciece, FAIR and good data mangment practices
- how adoption of those practices benefits yourself and your group/organization by:
-- improving productivity
-- speeding up inductions
-- helping with your managerial responsibilities

## Evolution of research and Open Science

PAULINE some text that follows my narrative from the test run. You can copy OS relavant information from the 02-OS-Intruduction episode (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-bio-practice/02-os-introduction/index.html) in FAIR-in-bio-pracice.
Rember it was much more condensed here (I copied the graphic and text for OS buildig blocks, and the follo excercise). 
It should reflect the key points from Power Point slides

### Open Science Building Blocks

* **Open Access:** Research outputs hosted in a way that make them accessible for everyone. Traditionally Open Access
  referred to journal articles, but now includes books, chapters or images.

* **Open Data:** Data freely and readily available to access, reuse, and share.
  Smaller data sets were often accessible as
  supplemental materials by journals alongside articles themselves.
  However, they should be hosted in dedicated platforms for
  more convenient and better access.

* **Open Software:** Software where the source code is made readily available;
  others are free to use, change, and
  share. Some examples of these including the coding language and supporting software R and RStudio,
  as well as image analysis software such as Fiji/ImageJ.

* **Open Notebooks:** Lab & notebooks hosted online, readily accessible to all. These are popular among some of the
  large funding bodies and allow anyone to comment on any stage of the experimental record.

* **Open Peer Review:** A system where peer review reports are published alongside the body of work. This can include
  reviewers' reports, correspondence between parties involved, rebuttals, editorial decisions etc...
  
* **Citizen Science:** Citizen participation of various stages of the research process, from project funding to collecting and analysing data. In other words, Citizen Science is when lay people become involved in scientific research, most commonly in data collection or image analysis. Platforms such as [zooniverse.org](https://www.zooniverse.org/) help connect projects with lay people interested in playing an active role in research, which  can help generate and/or process data which would otherwise be unachievable by one single person.

* **Scientific social networks:** Networks of researchers, which often meet locally in teams, but are also connected online, foster open discussions on scientific issues. Online, many people commonly use traditional social media platforms for this, such as Twitter, Instagram, various sub-reddits, discussion channels on Slack/Discord etc..., although there are also more dedicated spaces such as [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/).

* **Open Education resources:** Educational materials that are free for anyone to access and use to learn from. These can be anything from talks, instructional videos, and explanations posted on video hosting websites (e.g. YouTube), to entire digital textbooks written and then published freely online. 


> ## Exercise 3: Why we are not doing Open Science / Data Sharing already (4 min)
>
> Discuss Open Science / Data Sharing barriers, mention the reasons for not already being open:
>
>> ## Solution
>> - sensitive data (anonymising data from administrative health records can be difficult)
>> - IP
>> - I don't know where to deposit my data
>> - misuse (fake news)
>> - lack of confidence (the fear of critics)
>> - lack of expertise
>> - the costs in $ and in time
>> - novelty of data
>> - it is not mandatory
>> - I don't see value in it
>> - lack of credit (publishing negative results is of little benefit to you)

**Data management is a continuous process**

PAULINE below there is missing narrative that the overheads are small at each steps, that the overheads help also at the following steps. But are massive ath the end. Then there can be some of the points ... maybe with an edit.


When should you engage in data sharing and open practices?
* Data management should be done throughout the duration of your project.
* If you wait till the end, it will take a massive effort on your side and will be more of a burden than a benefit.
* Taking the time to do effective data management will help you understand your data better and make it easier to find when you need it (for example when you need to write a manuscript or a thesis!).
* All the practices that enable others to access and use your outcomes directly
benefit you and your group

In this workshop we will show you how you can plan and do your research
in a way that makes your outputs readily available for re-use by others.

## Why you should know it - power figures

PAULINE insert Ex4 your presence, ex5 Minions.

Then some follow up text about the responisbilities as power figures.

Inforamtion about DORA and narrative CVs.

Conclusions that it is easier to be prepared than to fake it.

## Why you should do it

PAULINE insert Ex6 Lottery winner

Repeat why good data managment help in leading own group/institution

Our agenda:
* We will talk about FAIR principles, which steps you should take
so that your "shared" outputs are of value.
* We will show you how Open Science related tools like ELN, code repositories etc benefit you as a team leader
* We will show you how public repositories make your outputs accessible and reusable.
* We will consolidate our knowledge of FAIR ready data management and data managment planning.
