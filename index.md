Open Science and FAIR principles change the way biomedical research is conducted, disseminated, and brings benefits to society. 
In this workshop you will learn how the adoption of FAIR principles makes you a better leader and how it can increase productivity of your team. 

## Introduction

Leading researchers must become conversant with the Open Science ethos, the Reproducible Research movement, 
and FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) principles to recognize or evaluate them in their peers, 
to mentor their team members and to benefit from efficient data management. 

This one-day workshop is aimed at established PIs and institutional leaders who set policy and drive changes. 

It will set the foundations of Open Science, FAIR principles and what they mean for biomedical research practices. 
The participants will be able to steer the adoption of good data management within their organisation and teams for the improvement of 
both data re-use and work efficiency.
