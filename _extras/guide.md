## Exercises 
Some of the exercises are optional, namely in Episode 2 "Being FAIR" we have provided exercises 1a "Impossible protocol" and 1b "Impossible average", which are intended for all learners, but we have added optional exercises 1c "Impossible numbers" and 1d "Impossible resource". 

In case there are a large-ish number of participants, some of the exercises are designed to be suitable for breakout groups; in the Etherpad template the instructions for these four groups are labelled with the names 'red', 'green', 'blue' and 'yellow' respectively.
